# üåê OS4CSAPI: Open Source for Connected Systems API

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the **Open Source for OGC API - Connected Systems (OS4CSAPI)** Initiative. This activity brings together open-source communities and implementations to accelerate adoption of the [OGC API ‚Äì Connected Systems v1](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogc-api-connected-systems/) standard through transparent, contributor-friendly workflows.

## üß≠ Mission

To build a traceable, standards-aligned ecosystem of open-source implementations that demonstrate interoperability, empower contributors, and advance the OGC API - Connected Systems specification.

## üèó Organizational Structure

OS4CSAPI was established to migrate coordination from personal repositories to a fully public, collaborative space. It includes:

- [`os4csapi-meta`](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/os4csapi-meta): Central planning hub for onboarding, sprint goals, and architectural decisions  
- [OS4CSAPI Project Workspace](https://github.com/orgs/OS4CSAPI/projects/1): Org-level board for tracking issues and implementation milestones  
- [Discussions](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/os4csapi-meta/discussions): Open forum for planning, Q&A, and standards alignment

## üß© Linked Projects

We collaborate with upstream and downstream open-source projects to validate, prototype, and implement CSAPI features. See the meta repo for a full list of linked repositories.

## ü§ù Contributor Onboarding

New members are granted base permissions to fork, create, and link repositories. To get started:

1. Explore the [meta repo](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/os4csapi-meta)  
2. Join active [Discussions](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/os4csapi-meta/discussions)  
3. Link issues to the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/OS4CSAPI/projects/1)  
4. Propose new implementation threads or repo ideas

## üìê Standards Alignment

All work in this organization aligns with the [OGC API ‚Äì Connected Systems](https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogc-api-connected-systems/) specification. We prioritize semantic clarity, traceability, and conformance.
